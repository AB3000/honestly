['A Couple Unwittingly Threw Away $20,000. The Dump Gave It Back.\n===============================================================', 'Advertisement', 'Supported by', 'The money, hidden in a box of possessions from a deceased relative, was returned thanks to a hawk-eyed (and honest) worker. ', 'By Anna Schaverien', 'LONDON — When a British couple dropped off a few boxes at a waste and recycling center after clearing out the house of a dead relative a few weeks ago, they drove off with no idea what they had really left behind.', 'Tucked away inside one of the boxes was 15,000 pounds in cash —\xa0nearly $20,000.', 'Luckily for the pair, according to a statement released by the police on Friday, a hawk-eyed — and honest\xa0— employee at the waste center helped ensure that the money made its way back to them.', 'When the team at the recycling center, at Midsomer Norton in southwestern England, suddenly found themselves with the unexplained box brimming with hundreds of £20 notes in a place where garden waste and broken furniture and electrical items are the usual fare, they started by calling the police. ', 'Then, with the help of technology and a little ingenuity, they tracked down the couple who had unwittingly left the money behind, who turned out to live 27 miles away in the coastal town of Burnham-on-Sea.', 'First, the staff members ran through the dump’s CCTV footage until a man was spotted on camera leaving the box behind. ', 'After watching him on video returning to his car, the workers matched it to its license plate, which had been automatically scanned by cameras that track all vehicles driving into the depot. And the police soon traced the car’s owner and address.', 'Without revealing what exactly had been discovered, the Avon and Somerset Police interviewed the couple in their home and at a police station until they were satisfied that their account of events aligned with the property abandoned at the recycling center.', '“No details of the discovery were disclosed to the couple,” David Bowen, a police employee who worked on the case, said in a statement on Monday, adding that once the pair were interviewed, there was “no doubt” that the money belonged to them. A police spokeswoman said that the couple were in their mid- to late 60s and did not want to be identified. ', 'The family was “shocked” and “aghast” when they learned of the substantial amount of cash found among what they had thought were worthless items, the police said.', 'But the couple were not entirely surprised: They told the police that the dead relative had had a habit of hiding money around the house.', 'As for the recycling center staff, although the Metropolitan Police say that anyone who finds valuable property should make “reasonable enquiries” to find the owner, the workers in this case were praised for their actions and detective work that went above and beyond expectations. ', '“Without their diligent attitude, integrity and assistance, the family would never have known about the money found, and we would not have been able to return it to them, especially in time for Christmas,” the police statement said.', 'The police said on Monday that the couple had given a reward to the staff member who came across the money — and who could have been in line to claim it if the owners had not been found within six weeks — but did not specify what it was. ', 'The local council responsible for the recycling center said on Monday that the worker who had made the discovery was not available to speak to news media. Instead, the council said in a tweet, the employee was “having a well-deserved Christmas break.”', 'Advertisement']

['E.P.A. Is Letting Cities Dump More Raw Sewage Into Rivers for Years to Come\n===========================================================================', 'Advertisement', 'Supported by', 'By Christopher Flavelle', 'Mr. Flavelle went 10 stories beneath Washington, D.C., to learn why sewage storage tunnels cost so much to build.', 'The Environmental Protection Agency has made it easier for cities to keep dumping raw sewage into rivers by letting them delay or otherwise change federally imposed fixes to their sewer systems, according to interviews with local officials, water utilities and their lobbyists.', 'Cities have long complained about the cost of meeting federal requirements to upgrade aging sewer systems, many of which release untreated waste directly into waterways during heavy rains — a problem that climate change worsens as rainstorms intensify. These complaints have gained new traction with the Trump administration, which has been more willing to renegotiate the agreements that dictate how, and how quickly, cities must overhaul their sewers.', 'The actions are the latest example of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back nearly 95 environmental rules that it has said are too costly for industry or taxpayers. That list grew on Thursday, when the administration stripped clean-water protections from wetlands, streams and other waterways.', '“When you walk into the current E.P.A., as a local government, you’re not treated as evil,” said Paul Calamita, a lawyer who represents cities seeking to change their agreements. “Which we’d gotten, quite frankly, from prior administrations.”', 'Cities that say they are renegotiating their sewage agreements with the agency include Cleveland; Seattle; Kansas City, Mo.; South Bend, Ind.; and Chattanooga, Tenn. Other cities, including Pittsburgh, Louisville and St. Louis, have already concluded talks for new terms.', 'The scale of many of the upgrades required by prior administrations is enormous.', 'For instance, Washington, D.C., which is considering whether to renegotiate its own deal with the E.P.A., is currently drilling the second of three mammoth tunnels designed for one thing: to hold 190 million gallons of untreated sewage and storm water. The tunnels will be used when the city’s aging sewer system is overwhelmed, so that untreated wastewater doesn’t flow into the Anacostia River, as it now does 15 to 20 times a year.', 'While officials in many of these cities praise the Trump administration’s flexibility, environmentalists say that the changes threaten safety by allowing pathogens and chemicals to keep flowing into rivers and along beaches and to back up into streets or basements during storms.', '“This trend is yet another example of the administration’s deregulatory agenda threatening our natural resources and public health,” said Becky Hammer, deputy director for federal water policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If cities face genuine cost concerns, there are other methods to maintain affordability while still keeping sewage out of our lakes and rivers.”', 'Since the start of the Trump administration, the E.P.A. has undertaken rollbacks of dozens of environmental regulations, including limits on the use of pollutants near streams and wetlands, on toxic emissions from industrial facilities and on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.', 'The latest rollback came on Jan. 23, when the E.P.A. reversed a 2015 rule that protected more than half the nation’s wetlands and hundreds of thousands of small waterways. That includes seasonal streams that flow only for part of the year, and wetlands that aren’t next to large bodies of water.', 'Farmers and property developers will now be able to release pesticides, fertilizers and other pollutants directly into many of those waterways, as well as destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects.', 'Asked to comment on the E.P.A.’s increased willingness to let cities keep releasing sewage, Michael Abboud, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said in a statement that the agency “has consistently stated that it hopes to achieve full compliance” with the law. “We will continue to work collaboratively with our local partners to ensure that protecting human health and the environment remains the top priority.”', 'Modern federal rules outlaw the release of raw sewage. But older cities across the Northeast and Midwest have older sewer systems designed to carry sewage and rainwater in the same pipes. When rain overwhelms those systems, untreated sewage gets released into local waterways.', 'Climate change has worsened the problem, causing systems to overflow more often.', 'Starting in the 1990s, the E.P.A., along with the Department of Justice, began entering agreements that let cities like these avoid fines by committing to detailed plans for reducing or eliminating the overflows. Those agreements, called consent decrees and approved by judges, impose rigid timelines for the work.', 'Under past administrations, the E.P.A. would sometimes let cities modify these deals, according to Cynthia Giles, who led the agency’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance under President Obama. But the bar was high, she said, citing the example of a major unforeseen disaster that made timely compliance too difficult.', '“A consent decree is not the opening bid of a negotiation,” said Ms. Giles, who is now a guest fellow at Harvard Law School. “It’s a legally binding commitment that is ordered by a federal court.”', 'The tunnel being dug beneath Washington shows the scale of the efforts required to comply with the federal rules.', 'The city, otherwise reliant on a sewer system that dates as far back as the 1870s, began work a decade ago. Ten stories below Washington, at the end of a two-mile ride on a cramped construction train through a vast tunnel, workers paused recently to explain the mechanics of a 300-foot-long digging machine grinding through the earth.', 'The digger, a dust-covered tangle of conveyor belts, hoses and thrust cylinders, chews through 60 feet of earth a day. When this section of tunnel is done sometime in 2023, it will be a five-mile-long, 23-foot-diameter tube, built to hold up to 90 million gallons of raw sewage that Washington’s increasingly overwhelmed drains would otherwise have to release into the Anacostia River when it rains too hard. It is one of the largest public-works projects in the nation’s capital since its subway system was built 50 years ago.', 'Versions of the tunnel are planned or underway in cities nationwide. Their cost — Washington alone expects to spend $2.7 billion on three tunnels and related infrastructure, funded through higher water bills — has prompted complaints that, among other things, the higher water bills impose a particular burden on low-income people and retirees.', 'In the Trump administration, the cities have found a sympathetic ear.', 'In the administration’s first three years, the E.P.A. has renegotiated about a dozen consent decrees with cities that use combined-sewage systems, according to Adam Krantz, chief executive of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, a trade group that represents water utilities. That’s almost as many as the 17 that he said the Obama administration renegotiated during eight years in office.', 'Mr. Krantz said he believed about half of the cities with federal agreements for combined-sewage systems were at some stage in the process of renegotiating the agreements. He praised what he called the Trump administration’s “more flexible approach toward regulatory and enforcement oversight.”', 'Water utilities “are environmentalists and public stewards,” Mr. Krantz said. “To the extent more time or flexibility is requested on a given consent decree, it is because it is needed to attain compliance” with the terms of that agreement.', 'Mr. Calamita, the lawyer who represents cities seeking to renegotiate, said the administration’s position reflected a series of separate policy shifts.', 'For more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.', 'Those shifts include a 2018 directive by Jeff Sessions, who was then attorney general, instructing his department to be what Mr. Calamita described as “more deferential to our local government partners.” Then, at the beginning of 2019, Mr. Trump signed legislation directing the E.P.A. to account for the various regulatory requirements a city faces, and the cumulative cost of those requirements.', 'Mr. Calamita, like others who support the agency’s new approach, said cities could not afford the cost of some of the consent-decree requirements, at least not under the timetables they previously agreed to. “They usually cut the best deal the could, figured future E.P.A.s would be more reasonable, and they signed these consent decrees,” Mr. Calamita said. “Almost all of my clients have consent decrees they can’t afford.”', 'Cities large and small have already renegotiated, including Pittsburgh, which got an extra decade to reduce its overflows; Louisville, Ky., which got five additional years; and St. Louis, Mo., which also got an extra five years. Chicopee, Mass., got an extra eight.', 'Akron, Ohio, has already renegotiated its original 2009 agreement twice, in 2016 and 2019. Officials are now seeking a third amendment, one that would let them avoid building an additional tunnel and other infrastructure that was intended to eliminate overflows completely, according to Ellen Lander Nischt, a spokeswoman for the city.', '“It’s a very expensive project for very little environmental benefit,” Ms. Nischt said, asserting that the amounts of raw sewage that would be released without that tunnel wouldn’t cause significant harm.', 'Mishawaka, Ind., wants permission to scrap a planned storage tunnel. The city, whose current agreement calls for it to stop releasing raw sewage, is also seeking permission for up to nine releases each year, according to Karl Kopec, manager of the municipal wastewater treatment division.', 'He said the city currently released about 4.2 million gallons of raw sewage annually into the St. Joseph River, down from 300 million gallons in 1990. Eliminating that last 4.2 millions gallons would produce “no measurable improvement in water quality in the river,” Mr. Kopec said.', 'Mr. Abboud, the E.P.A. spokesman, said the agency sought to ensure that the terms of the renegotiated consent decree were “at least as protective as the original.”', 'Another city seeking relief is South Bend, Ind., whose mayor until this month was Pete Buttigieg, one of the leading contenders for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination.', 'Mark Bode, speaking last month before leaving his post as the city’s communications director, said that Mr. Buttigieg had proposed a less-expensive alternative that would reduce overflows by 94 percent. “We expect to come to agreed terms in the coming months,” Mr. Bode said.', 'Washington’s utility, DC Water, is considering whether to renegotiate, in the hopes of avoiding the need to build a third storage tunnel, this one along the Potomac River, according to people familiar with the conversations. David Gadis, the chief executive of DC Water, declined through a spokesman to comment.', 'Tommy Wells, director of Washington’s Department of Energy and Environment and chairman of the board of DC Water, said he didn’t want the city to reopen that deal. “It’s our responsibility to the next generation,” Mr. Wells said.', 'Lisa Friedman and Coral Davenport contributed reporting.', 'Advertisement']

['The ‘World’s Largest Dump’ Is in Indonesia and It’s a Ticking Time Bomb\n=======================================================================', 'We take a closer look at that dumpsite reposted by Leonardo DiCaprio on Instagram\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------', 'This article originally appeared on VICE Indonesia.', 'The “mountain” is apparent from afar, greeting onlookers with a swarm of flies and a pungent smell. Trucks line up from morning until afternoon, bringing to the dumpsite all the trash consumed by residents of Jakarta, Indonesia’s largest city. Bantargerbang is quite literally a mountain of trash.', 'In September 2019, environmental activist and Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio reposted on Instagram a painful photo from @natgeo of the Bantargebang dump in Indonesia, calling it the world’s largest. The photo shows trash collectors, known locally as pemulung, making a living in a sea of waste and plastic.', 'Long before Leo’s post, Bantargebang’s inability to hold more waste was already heavily reported. Every day, 6,500 to 7,000 tonnes of trash end up in Bantargebang. Without a viable method of processing this waste, the dump may shut down in 2021.', 'VICE made a documentary about plastic waste in Indonesia, but it’s difficult to imagine how bad the situation really is. So our writer in Indonesia paid a visit to the dumpsite to see what goes on at the world’s largest landfill. ', 'The line of trucks stretched from the road to the entry gate of the dump located in Ciketing Udik, Bekasi, just south of Jakarta. It doesn’t take long for each truck bringing waste from the capital to pass the weighing post and get into the landfill to dump their trash.', 'Some reports say the mountain of trash was about 40 meters high in 2018. Edi Sudrajat, a dump worker, said no imported trash ends up here. ', 'The trash collectors climbing down the fragile mountain appeared to know every nook and cranny of the mountain and where not to step, as if it were their own backyard. ', 'But not all trash that ends up here is dry; some of it can be slippery to walk on. It seemed very possible for a trash collector to slip to his death from atop a mountain of trash.', 'A 53-year-old who has depended on Bantargebang as a source of livelihood for six years, also named Edi, often searches for used tarp.', 'When VICE asked him how he climbs the mound of trash, Edi, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, said there are depressions in the mountain for him to step on, but slipping and falling onto something sharp is a common occurrence. He said the last time someone died of an accident in the dump was in January 2017, when a trash collector was suffocated by the collapse of a trash mountain.', '“We slip a lot, especially when it rains. It’s summer now, but it’s not like this during the rainy season,” Edi said. “We stop [when it rains]. We are careful to watch where we step. When the wind is strong, we all come down from the mountain.”', 'The endless stream of incoming and outgoing trucks leaves a lingering stench in the air, which the trash collectors, many of whom live inside the dump, deal with on a daily basis. An online taxi driver who lives near the dump told VICE that the smell is the worst in the afternoon, when it can travel dozens of kilometres.', 'The Bantargebang landfill still relies on a system of open dumping, which involves dumping waste indiscriminately in any available area. However, Indonesia has laws prohibiting this dangerous method of dumping, as it can lead to the collapse of piles and the release of harmful chemicals into the air.', 'For instance, overexposure to methane gas released by organic waste can be a threat to human health–even death–on top of being bad for the environment. Methane directly contributes to global warming because it can absorb 34 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period.', 'Sudrajat said residents receive Rp900,000 (US$63.87) in compensation known as “stink money” every three months – the cost of giving up their right to live with clean air.', 'No matter the season, life is difficult for Bantargebang’s trash collectors. The dust-filled air poses a risk to their respiratory system and their vision. Leachate water runoff from wet trash exposes residents to the risk of diseases like diarrhea.', 'The quality of water in the area is also questionable. Even though artesian wells have been built to cater to residents’ water needs, there is no guarantee that it is safe for daily use. While some residents use the well water confidently, others question whether liquid waste seeps into the wells. Sudrajat, who spends long days at the landfill, doesn’t trust the water.', 'Despite the multitude of issues faced by the landfill, overload remains the most pressing problem. Jakarta’s waste management problem is like a time bomb. Realizing how critical the situation had become, the Environmental Department of Jakarta began implementing counter measures.', 'One of the solutions is to work alongside Indonesia’s Research and Applied Technology Agency (BPPT) to build a thermally-powered waste-to-energy garbage power plant. According to local media, a pilot project for the plant was launched in March 2019 with the expectation that it would eventually be able to process 100 tonnes of garbage in a single day, therefore producing 700 kWh of electricity. Thermal power was the method of choice for this plant, as “Indonesians’ trash is mixed, contains high levels or organic material, high moisture, and low caloric levels,” according to Hammam Riza, head of the BPPT.', 'The process involves the use of an incinerator, which Riza guarantees is environmentally-friendly. Information from the BPPT website explains that the garbage power plant at Bantargebang is equipped with three essential components that will minimize its environmental impact.', 'Firstly, the bunker is essentially a garbage storage unit equipped with a platform, a grab crane, and a reciprocating grate for incineration, allowing waste to be incinerated at temperatures exceeding 850 degrees Celsius. This minimises the formation of hazardous chemicals like dioxin and furan. ', 'The plant also features an Air Pollution Controller to filter harmful particles from the gas it produces. The final component is a pre-treatment unit that sorts out waste that is unsuitable for the incinerator, like metal, glass, rocks, and hazardous waste.', 'The power plant is still being tested, and Riza hopes the incineration process will not release harmful particles into the air. VICE reached out to the BPPT to find out how effective the tests were, but did not receive a response.', 'Meanwhile, some environmentalists believe the waste-to-energy plant is not the most efficient way to handle Jakarta’s mountains of garbage and will instead cause more environmental damage than the BPPT claims. They are now demanding that the government provide evidence that the land is suitable for such a plant and educate the public on the health risks before officially operating the plant.', 'Fajri Fadhillah, a legal researcher in the Pollution Control and Environmental Damage Division at the Indonesian Center for Environmental Law (ICEL), said he has never seen an environmental impact analysis come out of Bantargebang’s garbage power plant pilot project. “The BPPT and Jakarta governments say they’ve done an environmental impact study on Bantargebang, but both of their websites, where such information should be available, have not published the studies. It should be public information,” Fadhillah said.', 'Muharram Atha, a campaign spokesperson at Greenpeace Indonesia, explained that half of Indonesians’ waste is household or organic waste, which are unsuitable for incineration. Dwi Sawung, a campaign spokesperson for the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), said the process of incineration doesn’t fulfil one critical criteria: hazardous waste must be sorted out.', 'Wet trash, according to Atha, costs more to incinerate. Unlike dry waste, wet waste must under pre-treatment before being incinerated. Additionally, the incinerator requires fuel for optimal results. ', '“A garbage power plant must have a designated area for storage, as well as for the residue from incineration. The residue is known as ‘fly ash’ or ‘bottom ash,’” Fajri explained. The garbage plant itself can’t store this residue forever, for the sake of the health of people and the environment. “The ash itself must be processed further, a task that only a handful of waste management centres can do.” ', ' The Conversation Indonesia reported that since the garbage power plant is thermally-powered, it may still release dioxin that can cause cancer, reproductive and developmental issues, immune system disorders, and hormonal disorders. ', 'Ultimately, both Atha and Fajri said that most appropriate solution to over-dumping is to reduce the amount of garbage Indonesians produce. Manufacturers too should make efforts to create products that produce less waste. An even better solution would be to stop using single-use, unrecyclable plastics altogether. ', 'It’s also essential for residents to stop wasting food and sort trash to make recycling easier – because once trash ends up in a mountain in a landfill, it’s practically impossible to reprocess.', '"At this point, using less plastic won\'t really solve the problem entirely. We could be looking at a ban next if we\'re not careful," Fadhillah said.

['A Couple Unwittingly Threw Away $20,000. The Dump Gave It Back.\n===============================================================', 'Advertisement', 'Supported by', 'The money, hidden in a box of possessions from a deceased relative, was returned thanks to a hawk-eyed (and honest) worker. ', 'By Anna Schaverien', 'LONDON — When a British couple dropped off a few boxes at a waste and recycling center after clearing out the house of a dead relative a few weeks ago, they drove off with no idea what they had really left behind.', 'Tucked away inside one of the boxes was 15,000 pounds in cash —\xa0nearly $20,000.', 'Luckily for the pair, according to a statement released by the police on Friday, a hawk-eyed — and honest\xa0— employee at the waste center helped ensure that the money made its way back to them.', 'When the team at the recycling center, at Midsomer Norton in southwestern England, suddenly found themselves with the unexplained box brimming with hundreds of £20 notes in a place where garden waste and broken furniture and electrical items are the usual fare, they started by calling the police. ', 'Then, with the help of technology and a little ingenuity, they tracked down the couple who had unwittingly left the money behind, who turned out to live 27 miles away in the coastal town of Burnham-on-Sea.', 'First, the staff members ran through the dump’s CCTV footage until a man was spotted on camera leaving the box behind. ', 'After watching him on video returning to his car, the workers matched it to its license plate, which had been automatically scanned by cameras that track all vehicles driving into the depot. And the police soon traced the car’s owner and address.', 'Without revealing what exactly had been discovered, the Avon and Somerset Police interviewed the couple in their home and at a police station until they were satisfied that their account of events aligned with the property abandoned at the recycling center.', '“No details of the discovery were disclosed to the couple,” David Bowen, a police employee who worked on the case, said in a statement on Monday, adding that once the pair were interviewed, there was “no doubt” that the money belonged to them. A police spokeswoman said that the couple were in their mid- to late 60s and did not want to be identified. ', 'The family was “shocked” and “aghast” when they learned of the substantial amount of cash found among what they had thought were worthless items, the police said.', 'But the couple were not entirely surprised: They told the police that the dead relative had had a habit of hiding money around the house.', 'As for the recycling center staff, although the Metropolitan Police say that anyone who finds valuable property should make “reasonable enquiries” to find the owner, the workers in this case were praised for their actions and detective work that went above and beyond expectations. ', '“Without their diligent attitude, integrity and assistance, the family would never have known about the money found, and we would not have been able to return it to them, especially in time for Christmas,” the police statement said.', 'The police said on Monday that the couple had given a reward to the staff member who came across the money — and who could have been in line to claim it if the owners had not been found within six weeks — but did not specify what it was. ', 'The local council responsible for the recycling center said on Monday that the worker who had made the discovery was not available to speak to news media. Instead, the council said in a tweet, the employee was “having a well-deserved Christmas break.”', 'Advertisement']

['A Couple Unwittingly Threw Away $20,000. The Dump Gave It Back.\n===============================================================', 'Advertisement', 'Supported by', 'The money, hidden in a box of possessions from a deceased relative, was returned thanks to a hawk-eyed (and honest) worker. ', 'By Anna Schaverien', 'LONDON — When a British couple dropped off a few boxes at a waste and recycling center after clearing out the house of a dead relative a few weeks ago, they drove off with no idea what they had really left behind.', 'Tucked away inside one of the boxes was 15,000 pounds in cash —\xa0nearly $20,000.', 'Luckily for the pair, according to a statement released by the police on Friday, a hawk-eyed — and honest\xa0— employee at the waste center helped ensure that the money made its way back to them.', 'When the team at the recycling center, at Midsomer Norton in southwestern England, suddenly found themselves with the unexplained box brimming with hundreds of £20 notes in a place where garden waste and broken furniture and electrical items are the usual fare, they started by calling the police. ', 'Then, with the help of technology and a little ingenuity, they tracked down the couple who had unwittingly left the money behind, who turned out to live 27 miles away in the coastal town of Burnham-on-Sea.', 'First, the staff members ran through the dump’s CCTV footage until a man was spotted on camera leaving the box behind. ', 'After watching him on video returning to his car, the workers matched it to its license plate, which had been automatically scanned by cameras that track all vehicles driving into the depot. And the police soon traced the car’s owner and address.', 'Without revealing what exactly had been discovered, the Avon and Somerset Police interviewed the couple in their home and at a police station until they were satisfied that their account of events aligned with the property abandoned at the recycling center.', '“No details of the discovery were disclosed to the couple,” David Bowen, a police employee who worked on the case, said in a statement on Monday, adding that once the pair were interviewed, there was “no doubt” that the money belonged to them. A police spokeswoman said that the couple were in their mid- to late 60s and did not want to be identified. ', 'The family was “shocked” and “aghast” when they learned of the substantial amount of cash found among what they had thought were worthless items, the police said.', 'But the couple were not entirely surprised: They told the police that the dead relative had had a habit of hiding money around the house.', 'As for the recycling center staff, although the Metropolitan Police say that anyone who finds valuable property should make “reasonable enquiries” to find the owner, the workers in this case were praised for their actions and detective work that went above and beyond expectations. ', '“Without their diligent attitude, integrity and assistance, the family would never have known about the money found, and we would not have been able to return it to them, especially in time for Christmas,” the police statement said.', 'The police said on Monday that the couple had given a reward to the staff member who came across the money — and who could have been in line to claim it if the owners had not been found within six weeks — but did not specify what it was. ', 'The local council responsible for the recycling center said on Monday that the worker who had made the discovery was not available to speak to news media. Instead, the council said in a tweet, the employee was “having a well-deserved Christmas break.”', 'Advertisement']

The list of atom attributes for style cfg must\nbegin with either “mass type xs ys zs” or “mass type xsu ysu zsu”\nsince these quantities are needed to write the CFG files in the\nappropriate format (though the “mass” and “type” fields do not appear\nexplicitly in the file).  Any remaining attributes will be stored as\n“auxiliary properties” in the CFG files.  Note that you will typically\nwant to use the dump_modify element command with\nCFG-formatted files, to associate element names with atom types, so\nthat AtomEye can render atoms appropriately. When unwrapped\ncoordinates xsu, ysu, and zsu are requested, the nominal AtomEye\nperiodic cell dimensions are expanded by a large factor UNWRAPEXPAND =\n10.0, which ensures atoms that are displayed correctly for up to\nUNWRAPEXPAND/2 periodic boundary crossings in any direction.  Beyond\nthis, AtomEye will rewrap the unwrapped coordinates.  The expansion\ncauses the atoms to be drawn farther away from the viewer, but it is\neasy to zoom the atoms closer, and the interatomic distances are\nunaffected.', 'The dcd style writes DCD files, a standard atomic trajectory format\nused by the CHARMM, NAMD, and XPlor molecular dynamics packages.

Note that these coordinates may thus be far outside the box size\nstored with the snapshot.', 'The xyz style writes XYZ files, which is a simple text-based\ncoordinate format that many codes can read. Specifically it has\na line with the number of atoms, then a comment line that is\nusually ignored followed by one line per atom with the atom type\nand the x-, y-, and z-coordinate of that atom. You can use the\ndump_modify element option to change the output\nfrom using the (numerical) atom type to an element name (or some\nother label). This will help many visualization programs to guess\nbonds and colors.', 'Note that atom, custom, dcd, xtc, and xyz style dump files\ncan be read directly by VMD, a\npopular molecular viewing program.', 'Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N (including\ntimestep 0) and on the last timestep of a minimization if the\nminimization converges.  Note that this means a dump will not be\nperformed on the initial timestep after the dump command is invoked,\nif the current timestep is not a multiple of N.  This behavior can be\nchanged via the dump_modify first command, which\ncan also be useful if the dump command is invoked after a minimization\nended on an arbitrary timestep.  N can be changed between runs by\nusing the dump_modify every command (not allowed\nfor dcd style).  The dump_modify every command\nalso allows a variable to be used to determine the sequence of\ntimesteps on which dump files are written.  In this mode a dump on the\nfirst timestep of a run will also not be written unless the\ndump_modify first command is used.', 'The specified filename determines how the dump file(s) is written.\nThe default is to write one large text file, which is opened when the\ndump command is invoked and closed when an undump\ncommand is used or when LAMMPS exits.  For the dcd and xtc styles,\nthis is a single large binary file.', 'Dump filenames can contain two wildcard characters.  If a “*”\ncharacter appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is\nwritten and the “*” character is replaced with the timestep value.\nFor example, tmp.dump.* becomes tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.10000,\ntmp.dump.20000, etc.  This option is not available for the dcd and\nxtc styles.  Note that the dump_modify pad\ncommand can be used to insure all timestep numbers are the same length\n(e.g. 00010), which can make it easier to read a series of dump files\nin order with some post-processing tools.', 'If a “%” character appears in the filename, then each of P processors\nwrites a portion of the dump file, and the “%” character is replaced\nwith the processor ID from 0 to P-1.  For example, tmp.dump.% becomes\ntmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.1, … tmp.dump.P-1, etc.  This creates smaller\nfiles and can be a fast mode of output on parallel machines that\nsupport parallel I/O for output. This option is not available for the\ndcd, xtc, and xyz styles.', 'By default, P = the number of processors meaning one file per\nprocessor, but P can be set to a smaller value via the nfile or\nfileper keywords of the dump_modify command.\nThese options can be the most efficient way of writing out dump files\nwhen running on large numbers of processors.', 'Note that using the “*” and “%” characters together can produce a\nlarge number of small dump files!', 'For the atom/mpiio, cfg/mpiio, custom/mpiio, and xyz/mpiio\nstyles, a single dump file is written in parallel via the MPI-IO\nlibrary, which is part of the MPI standard for versions 2.0 and above.\nUsing MPI-IO requires two steps.  First, build LAMMPS with its MPIIO\npackage installed, e.g.', '```\nmake yes-mpiio    # installs the MPIIO package\nmake mpi          # build LAMMPS for your platform\n\n```', 'Second, use a dump filename which contains “.mpiio”.  Note that it\ndoes not have to end in “.mpiio”, just contain those characters.\nUnlike MPI-IO restart files, which must be both written and read using\nMPI-IO, the dump files produced by these MPI-IO styles are identical\nin format to the files produced by their non-MPI-IO style\ncounterparts.  This means you can write a dump file using MPI-IO and\nuse the read_dump command or perform other\npost-processing, just as if the dump file was not written using\nMPI-IO.', 'Note that MPI-IO dump files are one large file which all processors\nwrite to.  You thus cannot use the “%” wildcard character described\nabove in the filename since that specifies generation of multiple\nfiles.  You can use the “.bin” suffix described below in an MPI-IO\ndump file; again this file will be written in parallel and have the\nsame binary format as if it were written without MPI-IO.', 'If the filename ends with “.bin”, the dump file (or files, if “*” or\n“%” is also used) is written in binary format.  A binary dump file\nwill be about the same size as a text version, but will typically\nwrite out much faster.  Of course, when post-processing, you will need\nto convert it back to text format (see the binary2txt tool) or write your own code to read the binary\nfile.  The format of the binary file can be understood by looking at\nthe tools/binary2txt.cpp file.  This option is only available for the\natom and custom styles.', 'If the filename ends with “.gz”, the dump file (or files, if “*” or “%”\nis also used) is written in gzipped format.

The Dump Gave It Back.\n===============================================================', 'Advertisement', 'Supported by', 'The money, hidden in a box of possessions from a deceased relative, was returned thanks to a hawk-eyed (and honest) worker. ', 'By Anna Schaverien', 'LONDON — When a British couple dropped off a few boxes at a waste and recycling center after clearing out the house of a dead relative a few weeks ago, they drove off with no idea what they had really left behind.', 'Tucked away inside one of the boxes was 15,000 pounds in cash —\xa0nearly $20,000.', 'Luckily for the pair, according to a statement released by the police on Friday, a hawk-eyed — and honest\xa0— employee at the waste center helped ensure that the money made its way back to them.', 'When the team at the recycling center, at Midsomer Norton in southwestern England, suddenly found themselves with the unexplained box brimming with hundreds of £20 notes in a place where garden waste and broken furniture and electrical items are the usual fare, they started by calling the police. ', 'Then, with the help of technology and a little ingenuity, they tracked down the couple who had unwittingly left the money behind, who turned out to live 27 miles away in the coastal town of Burnham-on-Sea.', 'First, the staff members ran through the dump’s CCTV footage until a man was spotted on camera leaving the box behind. ', 'After watching him on video returning to his car, the workers matched it to its license plate, which had been automatically scanned by cameras that track all vehicles driving into the depot. And the police soon traced the car’s owner and address.', 'Without revealing what exactly had been discovered, the Avon and Somerset Police interviewed the couple in their home and at a police station until they were satisfied that their account of events aligned with the property abandoned at the recycling center.', '“No details of the discovery were disclosed to the couple,” David Bowen, a police employee who worked on the case, said in a statement on Monday, adding that once the pair were interviewed, there was “no doubt” that the money belonged to them. A police spokeswoman said that the couple were in their mid- to late 60s and did not want to be identified. ', 'The family was “shocked” and “aghast” when they learned of the substantial amount of cash found among what they had thought were worthless items, the police said.', 'But the couple were not entirely surprised: They told the police that the dead relative had had a habit of hiding money around the house.', 'As for the recycling center staff, although the Metropolitan Police say that anyone who finds valuable property should make “reasonable enquiries” to find the owner, the workers in this case were praised for their actions and detective work that went above and beyond expectations. ', '“Without their diligent attitude, integrity and assistance, the family would never have known about the money found, and we would not have been able to return it to them, especially in time for Christmas,” the police statement said.', 'The police said on Monday that the couple had given a reward to the staff member who came across the money — and who could have been in line to claim it if the owners had not been found within six weeks — but did not specify what it was. ', 'The local council responsible for the recycling center said on Monday that the worker who had made the discovery was not available to speak to news media. Instead, the council said in a tweet, the employee was “having a well-deserved Christmas break.”', 'Advertisement']
